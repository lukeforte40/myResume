            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>As a young software engineer I love learning new things about computer science, having taught myself to build a full CMS
                before entering college. I have a strong aptitude for problem solving. For example, I redesigned a rental storage system to
                reduce average pickup wait times by an average of 2 to 5 minutes. Throughout my professional career in the ski industry and 
                school I have prided myself for exercising strong communication skills, even being awarded by my school for exemplary communication 
                ability. I try to incorporate my programming into every aspect of my life, for example I made this resume in HTML and CSS.</p>
